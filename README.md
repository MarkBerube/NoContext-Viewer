# NoContext-Viewer

A small Backbone application that picks out a random thread from [reddit.com/r/nocontext](https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext) and prints it out in a nice, free font.

## Installation

Clone this repository in GitHub or download the repository as a zip.

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Unpackage the application and open up the command line. Head to the directory that has the application and enter:

`npm install`

node.js will install a bunch of node modules, after this you must install the bower modules using this command:

`bower install`

## Usage

Entering `grunt` in the command line of the working directory will build the application in the `dist` folder. Just copy the contents of that directory to a webserver and the application should be all set up.
